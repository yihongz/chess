# About the project

Chess Game is a console application built during [DevSuperior](https://devsuperior.com "DevSuperior's website")'s Full Java course.

The application consists of a board game where the objective is to conquer the "king" of your opponent. The board consists of eight columns and eight rows, which results in 64 possible spaces for the mobility of the pieces. The pieces are made up of eight pawns, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, a queen and a king. The entire project was developed using OOP concepts (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, etc.).
